Reproducible Research Peer Assessment 2: U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Storm Database Analysis 

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

In this report we analyse the U.S National Oceanic and Atmostpheric Administration's (NOAA) Storm database to investigate which weather events are most harmful.

By the end of this analysis you'll notice that tornado is the worst weather event to threaten population health for both injuries and fatalities. Heat is second as far as its impact on fatalities is concerned and thunderstorm is second as far as injuries is concerned.

In regards to economic damage, the damage to property is higher than the damage to crops. Of all the weather events, flood by far, has the most severe economic impact.
